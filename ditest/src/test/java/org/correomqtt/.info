# DO NOT RENAME THIS PACKAGE

There is a check in the Soy injection which checks whether the package name has `com.correomqtt.di.`.
This is due to direct injection of internal classes, however, external classes are injected via a factory. Thus,
the test package di tests the direct instantiation and ditest tests the factory instantiation.
